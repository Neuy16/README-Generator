## Description 

    This project is a rendition of my original portfolio using newly learned skills from the class. It is a single page application based on the foundation of React.js. It contains 2 of my previous projects, an about me section, a form to contact me at, and a shortened resume as well as a full downloadable resume.

## Installation

    To install this project, use (git clone <REPONAME>) in the terminal, then run (npm init) to install all necessary packages and dependencies.


## How to use

    *IF INSTALL FOR YOURSELF* (run (npm start) in the terminal to start development server. The server should start your default broswer and load the page there). Using the navigation bar at the top of the page, you can cycle through all 4 tabs to find theyre respective content.


## How to contribute
